    Variation of the game "Sea Battle".


    Each player draws a playing field of 10 x 10 cells on his paper and places ten ships on it:
        single-deck - 4;
        double-deck - 3;
        three-deck - 2;
        four-deck - 1.

    The ships are placing randomly, but so that they don't go beyond the playing field and don't touch with each other
(including diagonally). Then the players take turns calling the squares where the shots are fired and mark these shots
are on another identical 10 x 10 square opponent's playing field. If in any ship there were no hits, then he can move in
the direction of his orientation one square after each move opponent on the playing field.

    The player who first hits all the opponent's ships wins.
